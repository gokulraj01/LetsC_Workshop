## About the compile script
compile.bat is a small Batch Script you can run on your preffered Windows CLI (Powershell, Command Prompt etc.)
It takes in the C source code file (xxx.c) as the parameter and uses your installation of GCC to compile and execute the code to save you from executing the 2 commands to compile and execute repeatedly.

### Usage (Powershell on Windows)
```
.\compile.bat <path\to\your\file>
```

#### Example
```
.\compile.bat .\test.c
```
